On a cold, windy and occasionally wet August Sunday (bank holiday weekend) I took part in my second strongman competition down on Worthing's seafront.

I put a lot of preparation into this competition and placed absolute rock bottom. Like 10th out of 10 bottom. But I've had a lot of time to come to terms with what I think is basically a worst-case-scenario, but also accept it and move on with some positives.

To clarify this was only my 2nd strongman competition. Outside of the weight and age categories within the sport (of which there are a growing number now as it becomes more mainstream) - there are basically 3 levels of competition:

* Novice
* Intermediate
* Open

Obviously *Novice* is intended as the starting place, where athletes can try the sport out, and get some experience under their belt. The weights are relatively light (though you've still got to be a pretty strong person to work with them). It's a [Gentleman's Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen's_agreement) to only participate in about 3 novice competitions or until you get a podium spot before you're encouraged to move up to the next level, Intermediates.

The *Intermediates* (more often than not referred to as just *Inters*) is where things get a little more serious. The weights are downright heavy and the athletes tend to have a year or so experience at competitive strongman. I guess a lot of athletes burn out at this level because from my experience at looking at competitions now, the Open level category doesn't fill up anywhere near as much as the Novice and Inters - either they're competing less often or there are fewer of them around (probably a mixture of both, for reasons I'll probably explain another time).

Finally, we have the *Open* category. These guys are big lumps. Absolutely great athletes with crazy strength. As a fan of the sport it's hard not to watch these guys in awe, more so I think when you know full well how hard what they are doing is. To be a good strongman you can't have any weaknesses - so not only are they massively strong, they are often fast, with good cardio fitness and endurance/recovery and mental grit and determination that isn't often seen.
