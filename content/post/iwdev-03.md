So I've been a little quiet for a while now. There have been good reasons - life has just got really **really** busy again. One of the things keeping me on my toes is **#IWDev** (Isle of Wight Developers). One (code enthused) night I thought to myself - hell there are a whole bunch of web and software guys on the Isle of Wight (where I live and work); but we barely ever talk, we barely ever meet and we almost never work on anything together.

So I spawned #IWDev to help with that. Starting with a new Facebook group, hash-tag on Twitter (#IWDev, obviously) - and then promoted it through word of mouth. I almost immediately planned our first "get together" in a typical English pub to socialize and network... and see if the members wanted to take it somewhere.

We've just had our 3rd meet where 19 members turned up. We had two seriously awesome presentations and plenty of good talking. Here is my write-up on the even on a local news website:
