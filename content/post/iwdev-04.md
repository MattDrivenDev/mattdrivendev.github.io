The 4th #IWDev meet-up happened a week ago tonight. Checkout my write-up in the local online media:

[#IWDev 4: The round-up Yoppul](http://www.yoppul.co.uk/yoppulv1/2012/10/iwdev-4-the-round-up/)

I also pushed my presentation and source to GitHub for those who are interested:

[IWDev4-BDD GitHub](https://github.com/IWDev/IWDev4-BDD)

The presentation wasn't overly awesome (I'm a massive critique of my own work) - but the simple code examples and Q&A really seemed to light up a few eyes. Some really good questions came in as well.

On a personal note, one of the main things that I personally wanted from #IWDev was a channel for me to improve my presentation and "public" speaking techniques. The rest of this year is booked up for presentations now - but I'll get another in for January 2013.
