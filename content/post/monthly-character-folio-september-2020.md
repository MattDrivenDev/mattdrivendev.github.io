So I'm going to try and do a thing. I'm going to try and publish **at least** one character folio per month. It forces me to write, and it gives something back to the community. Hell, I'll probably even use them.

First up is a [Ventrue](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Ventrue_(VTM)) Childer - King of the Tower Block.

I wanted to create somebody that was slightly based on the [Tzimisce](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Tzimisce) *Lord of the Ghetto* example character from the revised clan book - but with a rather insidious twist from the [Sandman Predator Type](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Predator_Type_(VTM)#Sandman). Coupled with some use of [Presence: Lingering Kiss](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Presence_(VTM)#Standard_Powers_.28V5.29), you've got yourself a truely creepy monster that calls the tower his own.
