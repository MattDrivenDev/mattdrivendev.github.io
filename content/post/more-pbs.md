As I predicted a 5 plate (either side) squat went up on Friday of last week. <!--more-->220kg (484lb) with a belt and knee wraps only. The depth was good and the speed of the bar was good. I think that there is more in there, but I'm going to nail this a few times before moving on.

230kg is the goal before the end of the year - then I'll be in the 500lb squat club!
