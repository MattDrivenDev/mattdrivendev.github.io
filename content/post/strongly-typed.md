Another re-branding? Another new blog? I don't know Matt - you've got some kind of identity issues or something!

Well possibly. Don't we all? But in the case of some kind of online profile I don't believe that it is too much of a problem to refresh things every few years or so. 

A lot of professions and hobbies are getting more and more traction online, and people are using the tools available to them to "market" themselves. Either in the pursuit of better job opportunities, customers of some kind of service or to try and get a sponsorship deal. 

I'm no different really, and while my career stays in a constant direction - my interests vary greatly over time.

I'm almost 2 years in to strength training again now (having about 2-3 years under my belt in my late 20s before a 4-year break) - and have focused my efforts on competitive strongman. The similarities between software development and strength training are actually numerous - so I don't mind much using a single blog to talk about both of them.

I've sort of settled on a **Strongly Typed** branding for my blog, because it is a nice mix of what I enjoy in both Strongman and Software Development. It will probably make more sense to those that come here to read about Software Development than it does to those that want to read about Strongman.

So there we have it.

Strongly Typed.
